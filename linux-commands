linux is the operating system that sits between the users and the hardware.
unix was developed for multitasks in mid 1970
linux born in 1991

The user programs interact with the kernel which lives in the os and then kernel interacts with the hardware and provide the services to the users.

linux is case sensitive

Everything is a linux including physical devices like cd dvd and rom.

linux uses a hierarchy file system much like upside down tree with (/) as base all other directories are spreading from there.

Filesystem is a  method used by an opearting system to keep track of files on disk or partition.

/- root directory on sudo users can access.
/bin - commands used by all users and contain binary executables(compiled source code and also called  as eexecutables bcoz they executed  by the  computer)
/sbin - similar to /bin but it contain the binary files that located under this directory are used typically by system adimistrators/etc - contain configuration files required by all programs .this also contain the shutdown shell scripts and to start/stop indiviudla programs.
/dev - contain device files these include usb or any device attached to the system.
/proc - contain information about system process.contains about running process. ex. pid with the particular process
/var - variable files.It includes system log files(var/log) pacakges and database (/var/lib) lock files (var/lock) temp files(/var/tmp)
/tmp - temporary files created by system and users.files under directory are deleted when systems are rebooted.

1. / – Root
2. /bin – User Binaries
3. /sbin – System Binaries
4. /etc – Configuration Files
5. /dev – Device Files
6. /proc – Process Information
7. /var – Variable Files
8. /tmp – Temporary Files
9. /usr – User Programs
10. /home – Home Directories
11. /boot – Boot Loader Files
12. /lib – System Libraries
13. /opt – Optional add-on Applications
14. /mnt – Mount Directory
15. /media – Removable Media Devices
16. /srv – Service Data

ACL;

permission sits above the file permissions.
specific permission to specific user can be given by acl.

setfacl and getfacl.

1) To add permission for a user

3) To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/dir

4) To remove a specific entry
setfacl -x "entry" /path/to/file

5) To remove all entries
setfacl -b path/to/file

To get according to the delimiter;

awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd - to print first column in file by delimiter.

GREP/EGREP;

grep - global regular expression print

grep "pug" pugal.txt 
grep -c  "pug" pugal.txt - prints the count
